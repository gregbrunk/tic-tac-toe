My ADT's:
	1) Game Board
	2) Click Checker
	3) Reset Checker
	4) Who's Turn
	5) Player 1's Move (Too small, wont do)
	6) Player 2's Move (Too small, wont do)
	7) A Move
	8) Reset the Board

I Ended Up Doing:
	- Setup Game Board
	- Click Check
	- Reset Check
	- Reset Board
	- Start Game

I created a short term JS file for a clean refactoring work environment, but you can ignore that now. My updated code is all in tic-tac-toe.js and the index.html file works correctly.
